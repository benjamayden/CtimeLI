# Ports — interface contracts

A **Port** is an interface the application depends on; an **Adapter** is a
concrete implementation. Ports live in `ports.py` (Python `Protocol`s); adapters
live in `adapters/`. The application layer is written entirely against Ports, so
it can be driven by real macOS adapters in production and by fakes in tests.

Each port below lists: its **purpose**, its **methods** with pre/post-conditions,
its **failure mode**, and the **macOS adapter** that implements it. When you
port to another framework, you re-implement the adapters — the Port contracts do
not change.

Design rules for Ports (apply when adding one):
- **Narrow.** Expose what the app needs, not what the SDK offers. `WindowShaker`
  has `apply`/`restore`, not `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue`.
- **Domain types only.** Port signatures use `datetime`, `RGB`, `RenderFrame`,
  `CalendarEvent` — never `NSWindow`, `EKEvent`, `AXUIElement`.
- **Total, not partial.** A port method either succeeds or degrades visibly
  (returns `False`/`None`, logs once). It does not raise platform exceptions
  into the app layer.
- **No callbacks into the domain.** Adapters surface events as data the app
  polls or as plain values; they do not call domain functions.

## `Clock`

**Purpose** — supply time so the domain and app never touch a real clock.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `now() -> datetime` | Current wall-clock local time. Used for targets, parsing, calendar maths. |
| `monotonic() -> float` | Seconds from an arbitrary epoch, never decreasing. Used for throttling (calendar poll, dismiss delay) where wall-clock jumps must not matter. |

**Why two clocks**: wall-clock can jump (NTP, DST, sleep); monotonic cannot.
Durations and throttles use `monotonic`; "what time is the meeting" uses `now`.

**Failure** — none; this port cannot fail.
**Adapter** — `system/clock.py::SystemClock` (`datetime.now()` /
`time.monotonic()`). **Fake** — `FakeClock` with manually advanced time; the
backbone of every domain/app test.

---

## `Logger`

**Purpose** — all user-facing text. Replaces the ~40 scattered `print(...)`
calls so output is testable and redirectable.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `info(msg)` | Normal status (`Countdown → 14:00 …`). |
| `warn(msg)` | Recoverable degradation (`Shake disabled: …`). |
| `error(msg)` | A real failure the user must see. |

**Failure** — none.
**Adapter** — `system/logger.py::StderrLogger` (info→stdout, warn/error→stderr,
always flushed). **Fake** — `RecordingLogger` that appends to a list for
assertions.

> **Smell fixed.** The original printed directly everywhere, mixing `stdout`
> and `stderr` ad hoc and making output impossible to assert on. See
> [`edge-cases.md`](edge-cases.md) #16.

---

## `FrameScheduler`

**Purpose** — drive the ~60 Hz render loop without the app knowing about
`NSTimer` or `NSRunLoop`.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `start(on_frame)` | Begin invoking `on_frame()` at ~`FRAME_INTERVAL` (1/60 s). |
| `pump(seconds)` | Process pending UI events for up to `seconds`. Lets a cooperative loop (watch mode) yield to the GUI. |
| `stop()` | Stop ticking; release the timer. Idempotent. |

**Pre** — `start` called once per session.
**Failure** — none; on a headless port `pump` is a `sleep`.
**Adapter** — `macos/runloop.py` — `NSTimer` on `NSRunLoopCommonModes` +
`NSRunLoop.runMode:beforeDate:`. **Fake** — `FakeScheduler` whose `pump` is a
no-op and whose frames the test drives by hand.

---

## `CountdownOverlay`

**Purpose** — render a `RenderFrame` (the stroke + edge glow) on every display.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `show()` | Create one borderless, click-through, all-Spaces window per display, above normal windows. |
| `render(frame: RenderFrame)` | Draw `frame` on every display: stroke length = `frame.fraction` of the perimeter, colour `frame.color`, glow from `pulse_opacity/spread/phase`. |
| `set_base_color(rgb)` | Change the stroke base hue (calendar snap recolours mid-session). |
| `hide()` | Order the windows out (used while the stop overlay is up). |
| `teardown()` | Close and release everything. Idempotent. |

**Pre** — `render` only between `show` and `teardown`.
**Post** — `render` is pure output; it never blocks and never reads state back.
**Failure** — a display vanishing mid-session must not crash; skip it.
**Adapter** — `macos/overlay.py` (`CountdownWindow`/`CountdownView`) +
`macos/hud.py` (label + Finish button — the HUD is part of this port's surface).

---

## `StopOverlay`

**Purpose** — the full-screen block-on-end modal.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `show(lines)` | Cover **every** display with an opaque modal above the screen-saver window level, displaying `lines`. Start a dismiss-lockout timer. |
| `dismissed() -> bool` | `True` once the user clicked / pressed Return / Escape **and** the lockout (`_STOP_DISMISS_DELAY = 0.6 s`) has elapsed. |
| `hide()` | Remove the modal. Idempotent. |

**Pre** — `dismissed()` polled each frame after `show`.
**Why the lockout** — at zero the app yanks focus; an in-flight keystroke would
otherwise dismiss the modal in the same instant. See
[`edge-cases.md`](edge-cases.md) #7.
**Failure** — none expected.
**Adapter** — `macos/stop_overlay.py` (`StopBlockWindow`/`StopBlockView` +
controller). `lines` is data so future session kinds can supply their own copy
(room name, "remote meeting", …) without touching the adapter.

---

## `WindowShaker`

**Purpose** — wiggle the frontmost window in the final seconds, then restore it.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `apply(dx, dy) -> bool` | Offset the current frontmost window by `(dx, dy)` from its **original** position. Returns `False` if there is no target or permission is missing. |
| `restore()` | Return the tracked window to its original position; clear tracking. Idempotent and safe to call when nothing is tracked. |
| `available() -> bool` | Whether Accessibility is usable at all. |

**Invariant** — the window's *original* position is captured the first time it
is seen and is the reference for every `apply`; `restore()` must put it back
exactly. If the frontmost window changes, the previous one is restored first.
**Failure** — no Accessibility permission ⇒ `available()` is `False`, `apply` is
a no-op, the app logs **one** warning and carries on.
**Adapter** — `macos/shaker.py` (AX: `AXUIElementCreateApplication`,
`AXPosition` get/set). The standalone tuning harness `shake_test.py` imports
this adapter — it no longer duplicates the AX code.

> **Smell fixed.** `shake_test.py` had a near-identical copy of the shake logic
> (`ShakeTester`). It now drives the real `WindowShaker`. See
> [`edge-cases.md`](edge-cases.md) #10.

---

## `AppControl`

**Purpose** — query and steer running applications (focus, listing, activation
policy). Everything `NSWorkspace`-ish that is *not* block-end execution.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `frontmost_pid() -> int \| None` | PID of the frontmost app; `None` if it is our own Python process (so we never "restore focus" to ourselves). |
| `app_name_for_pid(pid) -> str \| None` | Localised name for a PID. |
| `activate_pid(pid) -> bool` | Bring that app to the front; `False` if it is gone. |
| `activate_finder()` | Fallback focus target after a tidy. |
| `running_app_names() -> list[str]` | Every *regular* GUI app (includes windowless ones). Feeds block-end pass 1. |
| `foreground_app_names() -> list[str]` | Apps with a visible foreground presence. Feeds block-end pass 2. |
| `set_activation_policy(policy)` | `accessory` (no Dock icon, used during a session) / `prohibited` (fully hidden, watcher idle) / `regular` (focusable, for the stop modal). |

**Failure** — list methods return `[]` on error, never raise.
**Adapter** — `macos/app_control.py` (`NSWorkspace`, `NSApp`, and one
`osascript` call for the foreground-process list).

---

## `BlockEndExecutor`

**Purpose** — *execute* a block-end plan. The **plan is computed in the domain**
([`domain.md`](domain.md) §6); this port only carries it out.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `execute(plan: list[(str, BlockAction)]) -> Counts` | Apply each `(app, action)`. `QUIT` → terminate, falling back to `HIDE` on failure; **Finder is hidden, never quit**. Return `{minimize, hide, quit}` counts. |

**Pre** — `plan` already excludes skipped apps (the domain did that).
**Post** — counts reflect what actually happened (a failed quit that fell back
to hide increments `hide`, not `quit`).
**Failure** — a single app that will not quit is logged and counted as a
fallback; it never aborts the rest of the plan.
**Adapter** — `macos/block_executor.py` (`NSRunningApplication.terminate` +
`osascript` System Events for hide/minimize).

> **Smell fixed.** The original `apply_block_end_actions` planned, executed and
> printed in one 60-line function. Planning is now pure domain, execution is
> this port, the summary line is the app layer's. See
> [`edge-cases.md`](edge-cases.md) #22.

---

## `CalendarSource`

**Purpose** — supply the nearest upcoming accepted event.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `ensure_access() -> bool` | Acquire calendar read permission. Idempotent; caches the result. `False` if denied or EventKit is absent. |
| `nearest_event_within(minutes) -> CalendarEvent \| None` | The nearest **accepted** event starting in `(now, now+minutes]`, or `None`. Declined events excluded ([`domain.md`](domain.md) §5). |

**Pre** — `nearest_event_within` self-calls `ensure_access`; a caller need not.
**Failure** — no EventKit / denied permission ⇒ both return falsey, one warning
logged; the app runs without calendar features.
**Adapter** — `macos/calendar.py` (`EKEventStore`,
`predicateForEventsWithStartDate:endDate:calendars:`). **Fake** —
`FakeCalendar` returning a scripted list.

---

## `InputSource`

**Purpose** — non-blocking line input for watch mode.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `poll_lines() -> list[str]` | Complete lines typed since the last call (may be empty). Never blocks. |
| `closed() -> bool` | `True` once stdin reaches EOF. |
| `close()` | Restore the terminal to blocking mode. **Must** run on shutdown. |

**Why `close()` matters** — the adapter sets `O_NONBLOCK` on fd 0; that flag is
shared with the parent shell and, if not cleared, can leave the user's terminal
misbehaving after exit. See [`edge-cases.md`](edge-cases.md) #18 — a real bug in
the original, now fixed by this port's contract.
**Adapter** — `system/stdin_source.py` (`fcntl` + `select`).

---

## `SignalListener`

**Purpose** — surface `Ctrl+C` as data, not as an exception mid-frame.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `install()` | Register the `SIGINT` handler. |
| `interrupted() -> bool` | `True` once `SIGINT` has fired (latched). |
| `restore()` | Reinstate the previous handler. |

**Why a port** — the handler must only *set a flag*; the app polls
`interrupted()` between frames and drives the state machine cleanly. Doing real
work inside a signal handler is the classic re-entrancy bug.
**Adapter** — `system/signals.py` (`signal.signal`).

---

## `EnvSource` (composition-time only)

**Purpose** — read configuration without a global side effect.

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `values() -> Mapping[str, str]` | Merged view of process env over `.env`-file values. Pure read; **never mutates `os.environ`**. |

> **Smell fixed.** The original `load_dotenv` wrote into `os.environ` and only
> for keys "not already set", so a second call silently no-op'd and tests could
> not isolate config. The loader now returns a mapping and `AppConfig` reads
> from it. See [`edge-cases.md`](edge-cases.md) #5.

**Adapter** — `system/dotenv.py`. Used only by `composition.py`; not injected
into the app or domain.
